Description: "In this episode: The [R-Podcast site](https://r-podcast.org/) is now powered by [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)! I give a tour of the new site and outline my next steps to make the production pipeline even more powered by R.  Plus I present a tutorial on enhancing the user interfaces of [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) applications that pay off for you and your app users, with a video version available on the new R-Podcast [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheRPodcast).  We round things off with the R community roundup, listener feedback, and package picks that make the _future_ of HPC in R a lot brighter.  I hope you enjoy episode 23 of the R-Podcast!"
