Barbara is a software engineer at [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com) working primarily in the [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) package. She holds a double major in Statistics and Computer Science from Macalester College. After four freezing Minnesota winters, she is back in her warm homeland of Portugal (but to the disappointment of many, sheâ€™s not a soccer fan).
