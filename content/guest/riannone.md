My background is in programming, data analysis, and data visualization. Much of my current work involves a combination of data acquisition, statistical programming, tools development, and visualizing the results. I love creating software that helps people accomplish things. I regularly update several R package projects (all available on GitHub). One such package is called [DiagrammeR](http://visualizers.co/diagrammer/) and it's great for creating network graphs and performing analyses on the graphs. One of the big draws for open-source development is the collaboration that comes with the process. I encourage anyone interested to ask questions, make recommendations, or even help out if so inclined!
