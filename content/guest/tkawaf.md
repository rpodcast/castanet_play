Tareef Kawaf is a software executive with over twenty five years of experience in building product teams at early stage startups.  He has led the development of products in the e-commerce, online video, and open source statistical analysis spaces. At RStudio he has helped create an organization that uses the open core model to build a sustainable business that contributes more than 50% of its engineering to free and open source software. Tareef is passionate about RStudio's vision of the positive impact that free and open source software can have on transforming decision making around the world and the opportunities it can unlock for communities that didn't have access to these tools in the past.
