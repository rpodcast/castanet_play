I am a software engineer at <a href="http://www.rstudio.com">RStudio</a>, and previously worked as as a statistical programmer at the <a href="http://www.rglab.org/">rglab</a> within the <a href="http://www.fhcrc.org/en.html">Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center</a>. I am a tool builder -- I enjoy developing computational tools that help researchers and scientists to achieve their analytic goals.

I completed an MSc in Statistics at the University of British Columbia, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/">Jenny Bryan</a>. My <a href="https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/id/132997/ubc_2011_fall_ushey_kevin.pdf">thesis</a> (PDF) involved the study of gene-gene and gene-Rx interaction effects, and statistical assessment of these epistatic effects in yeast growth curves.
