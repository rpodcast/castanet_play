Hello, my name is Garrick Aden-Buie. I’m an RStudio Education Certified Trainer and a data scientist at the Moffitt Cancer Center where I work in the Collaborative Data Services Core using R, Shiny, and the tools of data science to accelerate research towards the prevention and cure of cancer. Previously, I was a Ph.D. candidate at the University of South Florida in Tampa, FL in the Department of Industrial and Management Sciences Engineering where I helped develop a smart home sensor technology system to enable healthy aging in-place.

I’m a passionate R user and educator. I build web apps using Shiny, tools and packages for R, and dynamic, interactive, reproducible reports using R Markdown. Browse my [list of projects](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/) for examples of my work, a [selection of educational presentations](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/tags/education/), or review my [full curriculum vitae (resume)](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/resume/).
