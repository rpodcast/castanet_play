Chase Clark is a PhD candidate in Med Chem and Pharmacognosy at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He has been using R for three years and does a lot of work with Shiny. Recently Chase gave a [talk](https://github.com/chasemc/presentations/blob/master/RinPharma_Aug_2018/rPharma_Chase.pdf) at the 2018 R/Pharma conference about the [IDBac](https://chasemc.github.io/IDBac/) project, a Shiny application aimed to make finding new medicines from bacteria a little less serendipitous.
